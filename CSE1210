<p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone"> <b>internet backbone</b></a> is essentailly the core of the internet, large interconnected computer routes that are hosted by high-capacity network centres. 
many of these networks are held up by fiber-optic cables allowing for fast data speeds, large bandwidth and are unaffected by electromagnetic interference.</p>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">what is TCP/IP?</h2>
<p style="color:azure">A framework used to organize communication protocols for the internet and similiar networks.</p>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">internet servers that rely on client/server relationships. It uses the end-to-end principle to transfer data between servers faster and more reliably. </h2>
<h3 style="color:whitesmoke">
    <ul>
    <li>mail servers</li>
    <li>web servers</li>
    <li>file servers</li>
</ul></h3>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">what is hypertext?</h2>
    <p style="color:aliceblue">hypertext are text display that have refrences (links) allowing someone to click on them and be transfered to another site/ area in the site. </p>

<h2 style=" color:azure">how is the web related to the internet</h2>
<p style=" color:aliceblue">computers link each other to others all around the world a for content, the difference is that the internet transport it and the web uses the content.</p>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">how the HTTP is used to facilitate client/server interaction</h2>
<p style="color:azure">HTTP follows a request response model which makes the clients create a request anf the server gives a response of what was requested and relevent status information.</p>

<h2 style="color:azure">what is HTTP? how it's different from HTTPS</h2>
<p style="color:azure"> HTTP stands for hyper text transfer protocol which means that clients send requests through HTTP and than a server responds through HTTP. the difference bettwen HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS sends its data in a encrypted form allowing for people to be confidant that no third parties see the data.</p>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">How the web has developed.</h2>
<p style="color:azure">in the beggining the web was only used to find information and had some gifs and graphics. called web 1.0 it was created for a reading mostly and was unable to make direct contact with otheres it was also known as the read-only web. the newer version web 2.0 was focused on participating and contributing allowing for many others to create content and introduced things like social media. web 2.0 is still used today and the next step web 3.0 is still in it's alpha known as the "read,write and exucute web" allowing people to move away from large platforms to anonymous sites. TIm berners-lee envisions a autonomous open internet that uses ai and machine learning as a brain allowing for more complex things like 3-d graphics.</p>

<h3 style="color:azure">venn of web.</h3>
<p style="color:aliceblue">web 1.0 was very bare bones internet with only allowing you to read but you have wiil beable to read webpages until the internet collapses. web 2.0 allowed input from people causing a boom in the internet and made web 1.0 look boring which it was. web 2.0 still had the bones from web 1.0 though like gifs and many static html pages to browse but now created by random people. web 3.0 is like the prior versions with being able to have user input and getting to read and browse information but will be way more automayed and way more visually appealing.</p>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue"> markup languages role in the web.</h2>
<p style="color:aliceblue">they allow for structure and they format content. they provide standardized ways to define elemints making it easier for apllications to interpret and display the code correctly.</p>

<h2 style="color: azure">venn of markup and scripting languages.</h2>
<p style="color:aliceblue">markup languages are used to structure data and don't actually perform the task while scripting languages perform the task and are not compiled but interpreted. they both are used to code though one just actually exucutes the code.</p>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">the relationship between SGML, XML, HTML, XHTML, DHTML, MD</h2>
<p style="color:aliceblue"> every single one of these are markup languages. they all help make websites functional varying slightly between each language and can be combined/ used together by the use of XML.</p>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue">myself</h2>
<ol style="color:aliceblue">
<li>I would like to make a game of my own be it a roblox game or a actual one.</li>
<li>I have my own pc at home that is awesome.</li>
<li>I took coding in grade 8</li>
<li>I like playing games</li>
<li>I think education is important but annoying</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color:aliceblue"> my future</h2>
<p style="color:aliceblue">i could use this to create webpages for companies and do other freelance jobs of this category. i could use this to create text in a video game.</p>
